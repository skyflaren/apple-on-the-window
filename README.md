# apple-on-the-window
Collection of scripts I use to simulate MacOS keyboard shortcuts I'm missing on Windows, using AutoHotkey v2.0

## AutoHotKey
Simulates MaCOS keyboard shortcut behaviour for
- arrow keys & text selection with shift (with CMD and ALT)
- closing windows & applications
- cycling between windows of currently open  application
- deleting previous/next word
